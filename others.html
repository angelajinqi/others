    <p class="text">Webpage design has risen rapidly along with the rapid development of the Internet. As the main support for surfing the Internet, it has become very important due to the frequent use of the Internet by people. Prior to this course I was intrigued by the title of “interaction”. The first is getting started. At this time, my mind is full of questions, there are plenty of new languages and unknown things to be understood and mastered. I felt drawn into the coding aspect as opposed to designing. This stage was where I also felt a bit lost since I am unsure of what I am producing and blindly locate myself by adding ornaments that look cool but do not line with the overall concept. I clearly remember after watching the first module it took me ten thousand years to set my GitHub page correctly. I also encountered different challenges here and there with each project and exercises. For example the picture is not in the right position, or the display area shows incorrectly. Thanks to these problems which allowed me to add more toolboxes in my pocket and solve them one by one.

    <p class="text"> I encounter websites everyday on the Internet yet, I never paid attention before. After a period of learning and accumulation, I naturally started to pay more attention to web design including its use of colour, layout and its interaction with the user(myself). Apart from the exercises and projects which allowed us to obtain basic skills, the reading responses are very helpful in contributing to my development over the course as well. one of the takeaways from the reading is that my perception of the design system has gradually become clear. In the end we are still designing a visual experience and coding is just a tool we use to achieve certain results. </p>

    <p class="text">Now upon finishing the rapid 6 weeks course under responsible guidance of the professor, I am able to complete a digital experience. Although it was a short period of time I still learned quite a lot including html, css, p5.js, jquery, and ui style guides for the screen. Moreover I learned the importance of receiving and giving critiques, also being able to present and share the works I created. This course opened a new world - the digital world for me to explore further.
